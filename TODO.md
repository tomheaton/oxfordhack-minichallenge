## Specification

### Let's be specific

Introducing the MOPR: Merchant Online Presence Rater — a tool that will consume information about a business
and scan the web for their online presence including but not limited to reviews, map location and social media profiles.
Your mission is to create MOPR as you see fit given an initial database of merchants.

- Given an initial json file composed of sample merchants — the input — you’re able to generate another json — the
output — file with enriched information containing their rating and what impacted it.
- (do not commit your output file! it should be generated by the app.)
- For every input business, there is an output rating from 0.0 to 10.0 (one decimal point float) — file with enriched 
information containing their rating and what impacted it.
- The rating criteria is down to your own discretion: which services to integrate with,
how much each weighs in on the final rating is entirely open to you to experiment and decide.

You explain how to run your app in a clear, concise way; readers understand thoroughly
what the rating criteria for each input is;

### Clean, readable code

Your codebase makes sense and one is able to understand it without the need for inline
comments following along each step;
